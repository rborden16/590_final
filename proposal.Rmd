```

**Who will participate in the final project?**
I will be completing my project by myself.

**Will the project will be a data analysis project or a package?**
The project will be a package.

**Which git workflow from the Chacon text you will use?**
I'm not sure, since it will just be me working on the project.

**What will the project be about?**
*What is the background for the need for the project? I.e., what problem does it solve, and why does that problem need to be solved?


*What is the source of the data? Will real-world data or made-up data be used?


*What specifications will the final project meet? I.e., what will you produce (a single plot of this vs that, a set of tools that does these three things, etc)
