Title: Analyzes ridge orientations to find preferred stress orientation
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: This package takes a set of ridge orientations in azimuth and outputs the
    preferred orientation of the ridges and the formational stress. There are functions
    that find the mode of the data, graph the output on a rose diagram, and overlay the    
    stress orientation for the mode of the ridge orientations.
